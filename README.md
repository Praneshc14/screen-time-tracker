# Screen Time Tracker

A Python program that tracks your screen time by logging the currently active window and how much time you spend on it. The results are saved in a JSON file for later review.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following Python packages:

1. `pygetwindow`
2. `logging` (built-in Python module)
3. `json` (built-in Python module)

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/screen-time-tracker.git

## Usage

Once the script is running, it will track your screen time in the background. The active window and time spent on it are logged to `screen_time_log.json`.

### Starting the Tracker:
To begin tracking, simply run the script:
```bash
python tracker.py
